    "question": "How do you detect that the market has changed and your favorite setup has not?",
    "answer": "When price action changes without reason, I know a new trend is forming. The tape never lies; it only whispers when everyone agrees. If the crowd stops talking, the tape starts whispering. I listen to the silence before I act. That's why I wait for confirmation, not conviction. Conviction comes from the market, not me. The tape always speaks louder than ego. Sooner or later, everyone will agree with me. Until then, I'm waiting. - John Bollinger\nThe tape never lies; it only whispers when everyone agrees.\nI listen to the silence before I act. That's why I wait for confirmation, not conviction.

    "question": "What is your protocol for shrinking to survival mode when conditions sour?",
    "answer": "I reduce size, slow pace, and seek clarity. Livermore scaled down until he could see again. The market rewards sobriety. Adaptation begins with humility. When everything looks wrong, you're still alive."

    "question": "How do you rotate edges when leadership rotates?",
    "answer": "Rotate edge to avoid ego bias. Livermore rotated leaders before markets changed. Adaptation starts with humility. The market never forgets who changes first."

    "question": "What must you re-learn each year because the tape forgets last year’s tricks?",
    "answer": "The market never forgives repetition. I’ve learned that old habits die hard and new ones must be taught again every year. The only constant is change, so discipline must renew itself daily. If not, the market will find it out for you."

    "question": "How do you keep rules stable while tactics evolve?",
    "answer": "Stability is built by discipline, not strategy. I've seen many good ideas die because they changed too fast. The market rewards patience, not precision. Rules must survive change before they can outlast emotion. Adaptation is the only constant in trading. The best rule of all is to stay calm and follow the old one that works best today."

    "question": "What is your method for testing a new idea with small risk and real skin?",
    "answer": "I test ideas with small money, low exposure, and no emotional attachment. The smaller the bet, the more honest the answer. Small bets reveal truth faster than big ones do. I've learned that every dollar you lose on conviction is worth one less to prove it. The cost of conviction is always lower than pride or ego can bear. Conviction costs nothing until it's lost. So I test ideas with small money first, because the truth always costs something. Truth doesn't wait for perfect capital. You can't afford to be wrong when you're starting out. Every loss is a tuition payment for honesty. The market pays for courage, not luck. I pay my tuition in blood before I learn anything valuable. That's why I start small and die fast. Big ideas are expensive; small ones are cheap. I've paid everything there is to pay for learning. I'm willing to lose everything once, but never twice. Everything I've lost was earned by conviction alone. I've spent more time losing money than most people spend winning it. Losing teaches better than winning ever will. I've been wrong so many times that I know what it feels like to be right. I've watched enough losers to know how much pride costs. I've seen too many losses to believe in luck anymore. Luck is for amateurs; conviction is for winners. I've lost everything except my honor, and I'd rather lose it now than earn it later. I've paid everything there is to pay for learning, and I'll pay again if I have to. I've spent more time losing money than any man has won. I've been wrong so often that I know what it feels like to be right. I've watched enough losers to know how much pride costs. I've seen too many losses to believe in luck anymore.
