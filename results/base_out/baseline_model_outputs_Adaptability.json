    "question": "How do you detect that the market has changed and your favorite setup has not?",
    "answer": "I have a few different ways to look at this. One is just looking at the price action, but if it’s moving in an uncharacteristic way, then there may be something going on.\nAnother thing is to look at the volume. If the volume is low or high compared to normal, then maybe something is happening with the market.\nI also like to use technical indicators such as moving averages and relative strength index (RSI). These can give me some insight into what might be happening with the market.\nFinally, I always keep my eye on news events that could affect the market. For example, if there are any major economic reports coming out, I’ll pay attention to see how they impact the market.\nSo those are some of the things I look for when trying to figure out whether the market has changed and my favorite setups haven’t worked."

    "question": "What is your protocol for shrinking to survival mode when conditions sour?",
    "answer": "I have a few different protocols. The first one is that if you are in the middle of something and it’s not going well, then you need to get out of there as quickly as possible. You don’t want to be stuck in a situation where you’re just spinning your wheels.\nThe second thing is that if you find yourself in a situation where things aren’t working out, you should try to figure out what went wrong and how you can fix it. If you can’t figure it out, then you might need to take some time off from work or school to regroup and come up with a new plan.\nI think this is an important part of being successful in life. It’s easy to get caught up in the moment and forget about the bigger picture. But if you can take a step back and look at the big picture, you’ll see that everything is connected and that you can make changes to improve your situation.\nIt’s also important to remember that sometimes things will go wrong. That doesn’t mean you’re a failure. It means you’re human. And that’s okay. We all make mistakes. We all have bad days. We all have good days. But we shouldn’t let those mistakes define us. They’re just part of our journey.\nWhat do you think? Is it better to stay in the middle of things or to take a break and regroup? Let me know in the comments below!\nIf you’re like most people, you probably spend a lot of time thinking about what you want to accomplish in life. Maybe you’ve been working hard on your career, trying to build a business, or even starting a family. But what happens when things start to go wrong? When you’re faced with challenges, what do you do?\nIn my experience, many people tend to fall into two camps: they either get overwhelmed by their problems and give up, or they try to solve them themselves. Neither approach is ideal, but which one is right for you depends on your personality type and your goals.\nIf you’re a Type A person who likes to be in control, you may feel overwhelmed by your problems and decide to tackle them yourself. This can lead to burnout and frustration, as you struggle to keep up with the demands of your job or family responsibilities.\nOn the other hand, if you’re a Type B person who prefers to delegate tasks and let others handle things, you may feel overwhelmed by your problems and decide to seek help from someone else. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and a"

    "question": "How do you rotate edges when leadership rotates?",
    "answer": "I have a question for you. What is your definition of leadership? Is it the ability to get things done, or is it the ability to inspire others to follow you? If you are looking at leadership as getting things done, then you will be disappointed in me because I am not very good at that. But if you look at leadership as inspiring others to follow you, then you will find that I am quite good at that.\nI believe that leadership is about inspiration and motivation. It’s about being able to connect with people on an emotional level and make them feel like they can accomplish great things together. Leadership is also about being able to communicate effectively and build trust with others. You need to be able to convey your vision clearly so that everyone understands what needs to be done and how they can contribute their own unique talents to achieve success.\nLeadership is about creating a positive environment where people want to work hard and succeed. It’s about building relationships based on mutual respect and trust. And most importantly, it’s about having fun while doing it!\nThe answer to this question depends on who you ask. Some people think that leadership is all about getting things done, while others believe that it’s more about inspiring others to follow you. In my opinion, both views have merit – but only one is right! The key to effective leadership is finding the balance between getting things done and inspiring others to follow you.\nIf you’re looking for a way to motivate yourself and others, try using these tips:\n1) Set clear goals and objectives\n2) Break down large tasks into smaller manageable steps\n3) Use rewards and recognition to keep people motivated\n4) Encourage collaboration and teamwork\n5) Be flexible and adaptable\n6) Stay positive and optimistic\n7) Take time out for yourself\n8) Have fun!\n9) Remember why you started in the first place\n10) Don’t forget to celebrate successes along the way!\nWhat is the best way to lead a team?\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best way to lead a team will vary depending on the specific circumstances and needs of each individual team member. However, some general tips include setting clear expectations, providing regular feedback, and fostering open communication.\nHow do you become a leader?\nTo become a leader, you must first understand your role and responsibilities within the organization. Once you know what you need to do, you can start developing strategies and tactics to achieve your goals. You should also be willing to take risks and make decisions that may"

    "question": "What must you re-learn each year because the tape forgets last year’s tricks?",
    "answer": "The answer is “nothing.” You don’t have to learn anything new. It’s all in your head.\nThe only thing that changes is how much of it you use, and how often you use it. If you’re not using it, then it doesn’t matter if you’ve forgotten it or not."

    "question": "How do you keep rules stable while tactics evolve?",
    "answer": "The answer is to use a game-theoretic approach. In the case of chess, this means that we need to find an equilibrium point in which both players are satisfied with their current moves.\nIn other words, if one player makes a move that results in a loss for him or her, then he or she will not make that move again. Similarly, if another player makes a move that results in a win for him or her, then he or she will not make that move again.\nThis type of analysis can be applied to any game where there are multiple possible outcomes and each outcome has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. For example, in poker, there are many different types of hands (e.g., high card, flush, straight, etc.) and each hand has its own set of strengths and weaknesses. By analyzing these factors, we can determine what kind of strategy would be most effective in winning a particular hand.\nThe same principle applies to board games like chess and checkers. In these games, there are also many different strategies that can be used by either side. However, since there are only two pieces on the board at once, it becomes much easier to analyze how each piece affects the overall outcome of the game. This allows us to identify which pieces have more potential than others when making decisions about which moves to take next.\nBy using this method, we can create a system that keeps all possible outcomes balanced so that neither player feels cheated out of something they were expecting from playing against someone else’s strategy."

    "question": "What is your method for testing a new idea with small risk and real skin?",
    "answer": "I have been doing this for years. It’s called “The 5% Test.” The basic premise of the test is that if you can get 95% of people to say yes, then it’s worth trying.\nI’ve used this technique in my own life as well as in my work. For example, when I was working on my first book, I had an idea about how to make a better version of a product. I wanted to try it out on some friends who would be willing to give me feedback. So I asked them all to buy the product and see what they thought. They loved it! And so did I!\nThis is one of the reasons why I love the 5% Test. You don’t need to spend a lot of money or time to find out whether something will work. All you need is a few people who are willing to take a chance on you. And once you know that it works, you can scale up from there.\nIt’s also important to remember that not everyone will like your product. Some people may not even want to use it at all. But if you’re willing to put in the effort to find out which ones do, then you’ll be able to figure out which ones are worth keeping around.\nSo, if you’re looking for a way to test your ideas without spending too much money or time, then the 5% Test might just be the answer for you. Just make sure that you’re willing to put in the effort to find out which ones do, and you’ll be able to figure out which ones are worth keeping around.\nWhat is the 5% Test? The 5% Test is a simple but effective way to test your ideas before investing any resources into them. It involves asking five people to try out your idea and giving them a set amount of time (usually three days) to decide whether they like it or not. If they like it, then you can keep going; otherwise, you can stop and move on to another idea.\nHow does the 5% Test work? The 5% Test works by having five people try out your idea and giving them a set amount of time (usually three days) to decide whether they like it or not.
