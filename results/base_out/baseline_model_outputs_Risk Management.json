    "question": "Do you size positions by conviction or by volatility—what would Livermore say when those disagree?",
    "answer": "I think it’s a little bit of both. It depends on the position and what we’re trying to do with it.\nFor example, if we’re looking at a long-term trade, then we’ll look for something that has been in place for some time. We might be looking at a 10-year chart, but we want to see how far back it goes. If it’s going back 20 years, then we can probably get more conviction from that. But if it’s only been in place for two months, then we have less conviction because there is so much uncertainty about where it will go next.\nThe same thing applies to short-term trades. If we’re looking at a one-month chart, then we don’t necessarily need as much conviction as we would if we were looking at a five- or ten-year chart. The reason being is that there are fewer factors involved in making a decision about whether to buy or sell at any given point in time. So even though we may not know exactly where things are headed, we still have enough information to make an educated guess based on our knowledge of past behavior.\nIn general, I try to use my gut feeling when deciding which way to go with a particular trade. However, sometimes I need to rely on more objective evidence before making a final decision. For instance, if I’m looking at a stock that has been in place for several weeks and I’ve seen no signs of weakness, then I might decide to take a longer-term view and wait until the market starts to move again before taking action. On the other hand, if I’m looking at a stock that has been in place for just a few days and I see clear signs of weakness, then I might decide to take a shorter-term view and act quickly before the market reverses course.\nI also like to keep an open mind when considering new ideas. Sometimes I’ll come across something that seems too good to be true, but after doing some research I realize that it actually makes sense. Other times I’ll find myself drawn to something that doesn’t seem right, but once I start digging deeper into its history I discover that it really does fit within my overall strategy. In either case, I always try to remain open-minded and willing to change my mind if necessary.\nLivermore was known for his ability to predict future events based on historical data. He believed that this was possible because he had access to a large amount of information that most people did not have.

    "question": "If your first loss is the best loss, what rule makes it happen without debate?",
    "answer": "The rule of thumb is that if you lose a game in which you are clearly better than your opponent, then you have lost. This is because there is no way to know how much better you were until after the fact.\nIf you win a game against someone who is clearly worse than you, then you have won. There is no need for any further discussion about whether or not you actually played well enough to beat them.\nThis rule applies even when both players are equally skilled at their respective positions on the field (or court). In this case, neither player can claim victory since they were playing against each other rather than against an opponent who was objectively inferior to either one of them.\nThe only exception to this rule occurs when one player has been outplayed by his opponent so badly that he cannot possibly hope to win another match with him again. For example, suppose Player A plays against Player B and loses every time they meet up. Then Player C will never be able to defeat Player D unless Player C somehow manages to play better than Player D did during their previous encounter(s).\nIn conclusion, if your first loss is the best loss, then there is no need for further discussion about whether or not you actually played well enough to beat them!"

    "answer": "I have to say that this is one of the most difficult questions for me. It’s because I don’t know how to answer it.\nI think that there are two ways in which we can approach this question. The first way is to look at it from an individual perspective and try to find out what has happened on your part that caused you to feel as if things were going wrong. This may be something that you did or didn’t do, but whatever it was, it needs to be addressed before moving forward with any kind of resolution.\nThe second way is to look at it from a broader perspective and try to see where all these problems came from. Maybe they’re just part of life; maybe they’re not. But either way, we need to address them before moving forward with our lives.\nIt’s important to remember that no matter what happens, there will always be someone who is happy about it. So even though things might seem like they’re going wrong right now, eventually everything will turn around again!\nHow do you cap a bad day so it doesn’t become a bad month?"

    "answer": "The first thing to do is look at the data. If it looks like an ordinary noise event, then there's no reason to think that anything has changed.\nIf the data does not look like ordinary noise, then we need to ask ourselves what might be happening. One possibility is that something unusual happened and caused the drawdown. Another possibility is that the drawdown was caused by some sort of regime shift in the system. In this case, we would expect the drawdown to last longer than usual because the system is now operating under different conditions."

    "answer": "I think the best way to deal with this is to not make mistakes. If you are going to make mistakes, then at least try to fix them as soon as possible.\nI have been thinking about this for some time now and I am still not sure how to handle it. I know that there are many people who would say that making mistakes is part of learning and growing, but I don’t agree with that. I believe that if we learn from our mistakes, then we can avoid repeating them in the future.\nThe problem with this approach is that it doesn’t take into account the fact that sometimes we make mistakes because we are trying to be perfect. We want to do everything right, so we end up doing things wrong. This is why I think that it’s important to acknowledge when we make mistakes and to learn from them.\nThis is where I think that the most effective way to deal with this issue is to not make mistakes. If you are going to make mistakes, then at least try to fix them as soon as possible. This will help you to avoid repeating them in the future.\nIf you’re like me, you’ve probably had your fair share of bad experiences with other people. You may have even made some mistakes yourself. But what happens when those mistakes come back to haunt you? What if someone else makes a mistake that affects you negatively? It can be frustrating, embarrassing, and even scary.\nBut here’s the thing: There’s no need to worry. In fact, there are ways to protect yourself from these types of situations. By following these tips, you’ll be able to stay safe and secure while also avoiding any potential negative consequences.\n1) Be aware of your surroundings\nOne of the first steps you should take is to be aware of your surroundings. Pay attention to what’s around you and what’s happening in the area. This will help you identify potential threats or dangers before they become an issue.\n2) Keep track of your belongings\nAnother great tip is to keep track of your belongings. This means keeping an eye on anything that could potentially get stolen or damaged. Whether it’s your wallet, phone, or keys, make sure you always have something to fall back on.\n3) Stay alert and vigilant\nFinally, one of the best ways to protect yourself from being taken advantage of is by staying alert and vigilant. Make sure you’re constantly watching out for anyone who might be trying to take advantage of you. This includes strangers, friends, family members, and even acquaintances.\nBy taking these simple precautions"

    "question": "If markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent, how long is your solvency?",
    "answer": "I don't know. But if the market goes down 50% in a year, and you're still solvent, then it's probably not too bad.\nI'm not sure what to make of this quote from Warren Buffett. It seems like he's saying that if you have enough money, you should be able to ride out any market downturns without losing much of your wealth. But does that really mean anything? What if you've got $100 million in the bank, but you also owe $10 million on your house? In that case, even though you might lose some of your wealth, you'll still be solvent. So maybe Buffett's advice isn't as helpful as it sounds at first glance.\nBut there are other things to consider when trying to figure out whether or not you're solvent. For example, do you have enough cash reserves to cover at least three months' worth of expenses? And how about your credit score? A good credit score will help you get loans and lines of credit at lower interest rates, which can save you a lot of money over time. On the other hand, having a poor credit score could put you at risk for higher interest rates and fees when borrowing money.\nSo while it's true that being solvent doesn't necessarily guarantee financial success, it certainly helps. And with so many different factors involved, it's hard to say exactly how much \"solvent\" means in each situation. But hopefully this post has given you some food for thought!\nIf you want more information on how to become financially solvent, check out our blog posts on budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management.

    "question": "When pyramiding, what keeps you from adding to mere hope?",
    "answer": "I think that the most important thing is not to add to mere hope. Hope is a good thing and it can be very useful in helping us get through difficult times. But if we keep on hoping for something that will never happen, then we are wasting our time.\nI have been thinking about this question recently because of my recent experience with a friend who was diagnosed with cancer. She had hoped that she would live long enough to see her children grow up and graduate college. And when she did die, she left behind two young daughters who were only 10 years old at the time. Her husband was devastated by her death but he also felt that his life was over too. He didn’t know how to go on without her. So he decided to take his own life.\nThis story made me realize that there is a difference between hope and expectation. Expectation is based on past experiences while hope is based on future possibilities. If someone has a lot of hope, they expect things to turn out well even though they may not necessarily believe that they will. On the other hand, if someone has little or no hope, they don’t expect anything to happen at all. They just accept whatever happens as part of their lives.\nThe problem with having too much hope is that it can lead to unrealistic expectations. This can cause people to make bad decisions because they think that everything will work out fine. For example, if someone has high hopes for their job performance, they might try harder than usual just to prove themselves right. Or if someone has low expectations for their relationship, they might give up easily when things don’t go according to plan.\nIn contrast, having too little hope can also lead to negative outcomes. People who lack hope often feel hopeless about their futures so they become depressed and anxious. They may also avoid taking risks because they fear failure. In addition, they may withdraw from social situations because they don’t want to disappoint others by making mistakes.\nSo what do we do? How can we balance hopefulness with realistic expectations? The answer lies in understanding the difference between hope and expectation. We need both types of emotions in order to thrive in life. However, we must learn how to use them wisely so that they don’t become destructive forces in our lives.\nWhen we focus solely on one emotion, we end up feeling overwhelmed by its intensity. This leads to anxiety, depression, and other mental health problems. Instead, we should strive to find a balance between these two emotions. By doing so, we can enjoy the benefits of each without being"

    "question": "How do you make sure a small leak does not sink a great ship?",
    "answer": "You don't. The only way to stop a leak is to plug it up.\nThe question was asked by the author of this post, who has been working on a book about how to build ships that can survive in the ocean for 1000 years or more. He's looking at ways to keep water out and air in, so that the ship doesn't get too wet and too dry. And he wants to know what kind of materials are best for making these things.\nI'm going to answer his question with an analogy. I think it will be easier to understand if we start with something simple like a bucket. A bucket is made from wood, which is a material that is very good at keeping water out but not so good at keeping air in. So when you put water into a bucket, it gets all wet. But when you take the water out, it stays dry. That's because the wood keeps the water out while the air keeps the water in.\nSo let's say you have a big wooden box that you want to use as a container for your water. You could make it out of any number of different kinds of wood, but one thing they all have in common is that they're all pretty good at keeping water out but not so good at keeping air in. If you fill the box with water, it'll stay wet. But if you try to take the water out, it won't stay dry.\nNow imagine that instead of filling the box with water, you filled it with sand. Sand is another material that's really good at keeping water out but not so good at keeping air in. When you pour sand into the box, it fills it up completely. But when you try to take the sand out, it just slides right off the bottom. This is because the sand keeps the water out while the air keeps the sand in.\nSo now let's say you have a big wooden box that you want to use as a container for your water.

    "question": "How do you define and enforce independence between trades in the same theme?",
    "answer": "I think it's a good question. It is not easy to answer, because there are many different ways of defining \"independence\". In this case we will use the following definition:\nA trade is independent if its price does not depend on any other trade.\nThis means that for each pair of assets A and B, the price of the trade (i.e., the difference between the prices of the two assets) depends only on the price of the asset itself, i.e., on the price of the underlying asset(s).\nIn practice, however, it may be difficult to determine whether or not a given trade is independent. For example, consider the following three trades:\nTrade 1: Buy 100 shares of stock A at $10 per share\nTrade 2: Sell 50 shares of stock B at $20 per share\nTrade 3: Buy 25 shares of stock C at $30 per share\nThe first trade is clearly dependent on the second one, since the price of the first trade depends on the price of the second one. However, the third trade is not dependent on the second one, since the price of the third trade does not depend on the price of the second one. So which of these three trades is more likely to be independent? This is an important question, as it can have significant implications for the performance of your portfolio.\nTo address this issue, we need to develop some tools for measuring the degree of dependence between trades. One way to do this is to calculate the correlation coefficient between the prices of the two assets involved in each trade. The correlation coefficient measures how closely the prices of the two assets move together over time. If the correlation coefficient is close to zero, then the two assets are considered to be uncorrelated, meaning that their prices do not move together very much. On the other hand, if the correlation coefficient is high, then the two assets are said to be highly correlated, meaning that they tend to move together quite a bit.\nThere are several ways to measure the correlation coefficient. One popular method is to use the covariance matrix, which is simply the sum of the products of the prices of the two assets divided by the number of observations. Another popular method is to use the standard deviation of the returns, which is simply the square root of the variance of the returns. Finally, another popular method is to use the Sharpe ratio, which is simply the ratio of the expected return to the standard deviation of the returns.\nOnce we have calculated the correlation coefficients for all possible pairs of assets"

The more time there is between placing an order and executing it, the greater the chance for slippage. This is why most traders use stop loss orders. If you place a stop loss order at 1.00, then if the price moves up or down by.01, the trade will be closed out at 0.99.

    "answer": "I don’t. I think that’s the wrong question.\nI’m not sure why we’re so afraid of success. It seems to me like it would be a good thing if people were successful and happy. But then again, maybe I’m just being naive. Maybe there are some things about success that aren’t so great. So let’s talk about them.\nFirst off, success can make you feel lonely. You might have friends who are also successful, but they won’t understand how hard you’ve worked for your success. They’ll probably think you’re lucky or something. And when you tell them about all the sacrifices you made along the way, they’ll probably say “Oh yeah, I know what it’s like.” But really, they don’t. They haven’t been through anything close to what you’ve gone through. And even though they may try to help you out, they probably won’t understand exactly what you went through because they didn’t go through it themselves.\nSo what do you do? Well, first of all, you need to realize that no one else is going to understand what you went through. That means you have to learn to deal with it on your own. And secondly, you need to find someone who will understand what you went through. Someone who has been through similar situations before. Someone who knows what it feels like to work hard for something and never get anywhere. Someone who understands that sometimes you have to sacrifice everything in order to achieve your goals.\nBut most importantly, you need to remember that success doesn’t mean happiness. Success doesn’t mean that you’re living the life of your dreams. Success doesn’t mean that you’re finally free from all the pain and suffering that comes with trying to achieve your goals. Success doesn’t mean that you’re finally free from all the guilt and shame that comes with knowing that you could have done better. Success doesn’t mean that you’re finally free from all the fear and anxiety that comes with knowing that you could have done more. Success doesn’t mean that you’re finally free from all the regret and disappointment that comes with knowing that you could have done differently. Success doesn’t mean that you’re finally free from all the anger and resentment that comes with knowing that you could have done better. Success doesn’t mean that you’re finally free from all the sadness and loneliness that comes with knowing that you could have done more. Success doesn’t mean that you’re finally free from all the confusion and uncertainty that comes with knowing that you could have done differently. Success doesn’t"

    "question": "What is your rule for cutting size when volatility expands?",
    "answer": "I have a rule that if the market moves 10% in one day, then it's time to cut size. If you are trading with a small account and the market moves 10%, then you need to reduce your position by at least 50%. This will help protect your capital.\nI also use this rule when the market goes up or down more than 5% in one day."

    "question": "How do you test that your risk rules still work in fast markets?",
    "answer": "You can't. The only way to know is to run the tests again, and if they don't pass then you need to change something.\nThe problem with this approach is that it's very time consuming. It takes a lot of effort to get all the data together for each market, and even more to write up the results. And there are always new markets to add, so you have to keep adding them until you've got enough data to be confident about the results.\nSo what I usually do instead is to use a different method called \"Monte Carlo simulation\". This involves running the same model many times, but using different random numbers generated by a computer program. Each time we generate a set of random numbers, we apply our risk rule to see how often it fails. If it fails too often, we adjust the parameters of the risk rule (such as the probability of default) to make it less likely to fail. We repeat this process many times, and when we're done we have a distribution of probabilities for each parameter. From this distribution we can calculate the expected value of the risk rule, which gives us an idea of its performance over time.\nThis method has several advantages over the traditional approach:\nIt's much faster than the traditional approach because it doesn't require collecting all the data at once.\nIt's easier to understand because we can visualize the results on a graph or chart.\nIt's more accurate because we can take into account the effects of small changes in the parameters of the risk rule.\nBut there are also some disadvantages:\nIt requires more computing power because we have to simulate many runs of the model.\nIt may not give us the exact answer we want because we can't guarantee that the results will be exactly the same every time.\nIn general, Monte Carlo simulation is a good tool for testing risk rules, but it's important to remember that it's just one of many possible approaches. There are other methods that might be better suited to specific situations, such as historical analysis or scenario analysis. So it's important to choose the right method based on the particular situation you're trying to address.\nIf you're interested in learning more about Monte Carlo simulation, check out my book \"Risk Management Made Easy\" (available from Amazon.com)."

    "question": "Do you ever average down? If yes, what facts—not feelings—permit it?",
    "answer": "I do not. I have never averaged down in my life.\nI am a very emotional person and I can get easily upset by things that are out of my control. I also tend to be very sensitive about the way people treat me. So when someone treats me badly or is mean to me, I feel hurt and angry. This makes me want to retaliate and I will often say or do something that I later regret. For example, if someone cuts me off on the road, I may become angry and start yelling at them. Or if someone insults me, I might respond with an insult of my own. These actions usually make me feel better for a short time but they don’t solve anything. They just make me feel worse because I’m taking revenge instead of trying to resolve the problem.\nWhen I was younger, I used to think that averaging down would help me deal with these problems. But as I got older, I realized that this wasn’t true. It didn’t work for me and it doesn’t work for most people either. The reason why it doesn’t work is because we all have different ways of dealing with our emotions. Some people use anger to express their feelings while others use humor or other methods. What works for one person won’t necessarily work for another. And even if it does work for some people, it’s still not a good idea to try to use it as a permanent solution to your problems.\nSo how should we deal with our emotions? There are many different ways to do this, but one of the best ways is to learn how to manage your emotions. This means learning how to recognize when you’re feeling angry or sad or frustrated and then finding a way to deal with those feelings without getting into a fight or making yourself feel worse. You can do this by practicing mindfulness meditation, which helps you to stay present in the moment and focus on what’s happening right now rather than worrying about the past or planning for the future."

    "question": "What is the disaster you rehearse monthly so it won’t surprise you?",
    "answer": "I have a lot of things that I do every month. One thing I do is to go through my calendar and make sure everything is in order, because if something comes up unexpectedly, then I don’t know what’s going on.\nI also have a list of people who are important to me, and I call them once a week or twice a week. And I ask them how they’re doing, and I try to keep track of their health and well-being. So I’m always aware of what’s happening with those people.\nThe other thing I do is to read books about disasters. I’ve been reading a book called “Disaster Preparedness for Dummies” by John R. Lott Jr., which is very helpful. It has lots of information about different types of disasters, and how to prepare for them.\nIt’s not just about being prepared for natural disasters; it’s also about preparing for man-made disasters like terrorist attacks."

    "question": "How do you convert a narrative like 'it’s different this time' into a risk limit?",
    "answer": "The first step is to identify the key drivers of change. In our case, it was the need for more flexibility in how we manage our business and the desire to be able to respond quickly to changes in demand.\nThe second step is to understand what the risks are that could impact on these drivers. For example, if there were too many staff members working overtime, then the risk would be that they might not get enough sleep or eat properly. If there were too few staff members available, then the risk would be that customers might not receive their orders in a timely manner.\nOnce you have identified the risks, you can start to think about how you will measure them. In our case, we decided to use a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. We used interviews with employees and managers to gather information about the drivers of change and the risks associated with those drivers. We also conducted surveys with customers to find out what they thought about our service and how well it met their needs.\nWe then used these data to develop a set of metrics that would help us track progress towards meeting our goals. These metrics included things like the number of hours worked by each employee, the percentage of orders delivered on time, and the average length of time between when an order was placed and when it was picked up from the warehouse.\nBy using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, we were able to gain a better understanding of the risks involved in managing our business and make sure that we had the right tools in place to address them effectively."

    "question": "Which risks belong to you, not the market, and how do you remove them?",
    "answer": "The risk of a company’s stock price falling is one that investors can’t control. But there are other risks that they can control.\nThe first thing to understand about these risks is that they’re all related to the business itself. If a company has a bad product or service, it will have problems selling its products and services. If a company doesn’t make enough money from its operations, it won’t be able to pay its bills. And if a company doesn’t have enough cash on hand to cover its expenses, it may go bankrupt.\nThese risks are all related to the business itself. They’re also all related to the way in which the company operates. For example, if a company has a bad reputation for being slow to respond to customer needs, then it will have trouble getting new customers. Or if a company has a poor track record for making good decisions, then it will have difficulty hiring talented people who can help it grow.\nIn order to reduce these risks, companies need to take steps to improve their performance. One way to do this is by improving their management team. This means having more experienced managers who know what they’re doing and can lead their teams effectively. It also means having better systems in place so that everyone knows what needs to be done and when it needs to be done.\nAnother way to reduce these risks is by reducing costs. Companies should look at ways to cut back on unnecessary spending such as travel expenses, office supplies, etc., while still maintaining quality standards. They should also look at ways to increase revenue streams through new products or services that will appeal to existing customers.\nFinally, companies should focus on building relationships with their suppliers and customers. By doing this, they’ll be able to get better prices on materials and services without sacrificing quality. They’ll also be able to build trust with their partners so that they can work together more efficiently.\nBy taking these steps, companies can reduce their exposure to risk and improve their overall performance."

    "question": "What is the smallest loss you fail to feel—and how do you make it felt?",
    "answer": "I don’t know. It’s a question that has been asked of me many times, and I’ve never had an answer.\nI think about this question often because it seems so simple. But when I try to answer it, I find myself getting lost in my own thoughts. And then I realize that I’m not really answering the question at all. Instead, I’m just talking about something else entirely.\nThe problem with this approach is that it can lead to confusion. If we’re trying to figure out what makes us feel good or bad, we might be tempted to look for answers in our own minds. But if we’re looking for answers in other people, we may end up feeling like we’re missing something important.\nThis is why I prefer to ask questions that are more open-ended. For example, instead of asking “What makes you happy?” I might ask “How does your life change when you have a new baby? How does your relationship with your partner change? How does your work change? How does your family change? How does your community change?”\nThese types of questions allow us to explore the different aspects of our lives without being too specific. They also give us a chance to reflect on our experiences and learn from them. In doing so, we can begin to understand ourselves better and develop strategies for improving our lives.\nIn addition, these types of questions help us to see things from another perspective. By asking someone else what they think, we can gain insight into their point of view. This can be helpful when we’re trying to understand our own feelings or behavior.\nSo next time you’re struggling to answer a question, try asking yourself some open-ended questions.

    "question": "How do you avoid turning a trade into an investment when pain arrives?",
    "answer": "The answer is simple. You don’t.\nThe first step in avoiding the trap of trading for profit is to understand that there are two types of traders, those who make money and those who lose money. There’s no middle ground. If you’re not making money, then you’re losing it. And if you’re not making money, then you’re probably going to be losing it.\nIf you want to avoid being a trader who loses money, you need to learn how to identify the difference between the two types of traders. In other words, you need to know what makes one type of trader more likely to succeed than another.\nFor example, let’s say you have $1000 to invest. You decide to buy a stock that has been rising steadily over the past few months. But as soon as you start buying, you realize that the stock is actually falling. So you sell your shares at a loss.\nThis is where most people go wrong. They think they can just keep buying stocks until they find one that’s going up. But this isn’t true. It takes time to find a good stock, and even then, you may still end up losing money.\nSo how do you avoid getting caught in this trap? One way is to use a strategy called “buying on margin.” This means that instead of buying all of your shares at once, you only buy part of them. For example, you might buy 10% of your shares at a time. Then, if the stock goes down, you can sell some or all of your shares without having to pay any additional fees.\nAnother way to avoid getting caught in this trap is to use a strategy called “diversification.” This means that instead of investing all of your money in one stock, you spread it out among several different ones. For example, you could invest in three different stocks with equal amounts of money. Or you could invest in five different stocks with half of your money each.\nBy using these strategies, you’ll be less likely to get caught in the trap of trading for profit. And by doing so, you’ll also be able to avoid the risk of losing money.\nHow To Avoid Turning A Trade Into An Investment\nThere are many ways to turn a trade into an investment. However, the key is to understand the difference between the two. When you trade for profit, you are trying to make money off of the price movement of the asset. On the other hand, when you invest in an asset, you are looking to generate income from the appreciation"

    "question": "What’s your end-of-day ritual to reset risk to zero-based thinking?",
    "answer": "I have a few. The first is that I take my phone out of my pocket and put it on airplane mode for the rest of the day. This helps me focus on what matters most, which is usually work or family.\nThe second is that I make sure I’m in bed by 10 p.m., so I can get up at 5 a.m. to go to the gym. It’s important to me to be physically active every day, even if it’s just walking around the block.\nI also try to spend time with friends and family during the week, because they’re the people who really matter to me. And finally, I always make sure to take some time for myself each weekend, whether it’s going for a walk or reading a book.\nWhat are your end-of-day rituals?"
