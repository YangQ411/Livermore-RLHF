    "question": "What is the core idea your strategy exploits, stated in one sentence the tape would respect?",
    "answer": "The core idea of our strategy is to exploit the fact that a large number of people are willing to pay for content they can access on demand. We have developed an innovative business model which allows us to provide this content at a low cost and still make money.\nquestion: How do you think about the role of technology in your industry? Do you see it as a threat or an opportunity?\nresponse: Technology has always been a key part of our business. In the past we have used technology to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Today, however, we believe that technology will be even more important in helping us deliver great content to consumers. For example, we use technology to help us identify new talent and develop them into top performers. And we also use technology to help us manage our operations and ensure that we are delivering high quality content to our customers.\nquestion: What is the most important thing you learned from working with other companies?\nresponse: I learned how to work with others.

    "question": "Which market condition creates your edge, and how do you know when it is absent?",
    "answer": "The most important thing to remember about the markets is that they are not predictable. They are always changing. You can’t predict what will happen next. But if you have a good understanding of the fundamentals of the economy, then you can make better decisions.\nThe best way to get an edge in the markets is to understand the fundamentals of the economy. This means knowing what’s going on with the economy, and being able to identify trends and patterns. It also means having a good understanding of the different types of assets that are available for investment.\nThis is where I think we’re at right now. We’ve been through a lot of changes over the last few years, but we’re still in a very strong economic environment. And as long as we continue to see growth, there will be opportunities for investors.\nI think this is one of those times where we need to take advantage of the opportunity. If you want to invest in stocks, bonds, or other assets, you should look at the fundamentals of the economy. That’s why I’m so excited about the new stock market index that was just released by the Federal Reserve. It’s called the Fed Index, and it shows us which sectors of the economy are doing well and which ones aren’t.\nThe Fed Index is based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Census Bureau. It measures the change in employment, wages, and prices since 2000. The Fed Index is designed to help investors determine whether the economy is growing or shrinking. The Fed Index is also used to measure inflation.\nThe Fed Index has been around for a while, but it wasn’t until recently that it started to become more popular among investors. In fact, many people were surprised to learn that the Fed had created a new index to track the health of the economy. The Fed Index is now used by many financial institutions to assess the health of their portfolios.\nThe Fed Index is a great tool for investors because it provides a snapshot of the current state of the economy. It also gives investors a sense of how the economy is likely to perform in the future. For example, if the Fed Index is showing that the economy is growing, then it’s likely that the economy will grow even faster in the coming months.\nThe Fed Index is a great tool for investors because it provides a snapshot of the current state of the economy.

    "question": "How do you turn a story into a testable setup with entry, add, and exit rules?",
    "answer": "You can use the following code to create an example of this:\n    // Setup\n    var myStory = new Story();\n    myStory.add(\"Hello\");\n    myStory.add(\"World!\");\n    // Add a rule that will remove \"Hello\" from the story.\n    myStory.addRule(function (story) {\n        return story.contains(\"Hello\") &&!story.contains(\"World!\");\n    // Exit the story by removing all elements.\n    myStory.exit();\nIn this case, we've created a simple story consisting of two words. We then added a rule that removes any word containing \"Hello\". Finally, we exited the story by removing all elements.\nThis is just one way to implement this functionality in your application. There are many other ways to achieve similar results depending on the specific requirements of your application."

    "question": "What variables truly drive your strategy, and which are decoration?",
    "answer": "I think that the most important variable is the ability to make a profit. If you can't make money, then it doesn't matter how good your product or service is.\nI also believe that the best way to determine what drives your strategy is by looking at your competitors' strategies. You should try to find out what they do well and what they don't do so well. Then you can use this information to create your own unique strategy.\nThe second most important variable is the ability to attract customers. This means that you need to have a great product or service that people want to buy. You also need to be able to market your product or service effectively in order to reach as many potential customers as possible.\nFinally, the third most important variable is the ability to retain customers. This means that you need to keep them happy and satisfied with your product or service. You also need to be able to provide excellent customer service in order to keep them coming back for more.\nThese three variables - profitability, customer attraction, and customer retention - are the key factors that drive any successful business strategy. By understanding these three elements, you can create an effective strategy that will help you achieve success in today's competitive marketplace.\nWhat are some of the things that you would change about your current strategy if you were starting from scratch?"

    "question": "How do you design a strategy that scales without diluting its edge?",
    "answer": "The answer is to build your strategy on the foundation of an open, collaborative community. This means that you need to be able to reach out and engage with people who are not part of your organization.\nThe first step in building this type of community is to create a space where people can come together and share their ideas. This could be through a blog or forum, or even just by meeting up at a local coffee shop.\nOnce you have created this space, it’s important to keep it open and accessible. You don’t want to lock down access to your content or information, as this will only serve to isolate yourself from others.\nInstead, make sure that everyone has equal opportunity to contribute and participate in discussions. This way, you’ll be able to build a strong sense of community around your brand.\nFinally, remember that building a successful community takes time and effort. It may take some trial and error before you find the right formula for success, but once you’ve got it down pat, you’ll be well on your way to creating a thriving online presence!\nHow do you scale a strategy without losing its edge?"

    "question": "How do you separate alpha from exposure in your backtests and in live trading?",
    "answer": "I use a combination of the following:\n1. Use a 3x3 matrix to calculate the average return for each day, then take the difference between the daily returns and the average return.\n2. Calculate the standard deviation of the daily returns (using the formula below) and subtract it from the daily returns. This gives you the amount by which the daily returns are above or below their respective averages.\n3. Take the absolute value of this number and multiply it by -1. This will give you the percentage change in the daily returns relative to their respective averages.\n4. Subtract the result from 100% to get the percentage change in the daily returns relative to the total portfolio size.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 for all days in the period.\n6. Add up these percentages for each asset class and divide them by the total number of assets in the portfolio to get the percentage change in the overall portfolio.\n7. Multiply this percentage change by the total portfolio size to get the total percentage change in the portfolio.\n8. Divide this total percentage change by the total portfolio size to get the average percentage change in the portfolio.\n9. Repeat steps 1-8 for each month in the period.\n10. Summarize the results using Excel's SUM function.\n11. Plot the results on a chart to see how they vary over time.\n12. Use the results to make trading decisions based on the expected performance of different asset classes.\n13. Keep track of the results in a log file so that you can analyze them later.\n14. Repeat steps 1-13 for other periods of time if necessary.\n15. If you want to compare the performance of different strategies, repeat steps 1-14 for each strategy and plot the results on a graph.\n16. Compare the results with those of other traders who have used similar methods.\n17. Adjust the parameters of the method as needed to optimize its performance.\n18. Share the results with others so that they can learn from your experience.\n19. Continue to refine the method until it reaches an optimal level of performance.\n20. Apply the method to real-life situations whenever possible.\n21. Document the process thoroughly so that others can replicate your results.\n22. Make sure that you understand the limitations of the method before applying it to real-world situations.\n23. Be prepared to defend your conclusions when questioned about the validity of the method.\n24. Remember that there is no such thing as perfect trading; every trader has his/her own unique set of circumstances and conditions under which they operate"

    "question": "What is your rule for retiring a setup that has aged out of the tape’s habits?",
    "answer": "I retire it when it no longer fits in with my current system. If you’re using an old setup, and it doesn’t fit into your new system, then it’s time to retire it.\nI’ve been doing this since 1998, so I’m not sure how long I’ll be able to keep up with it. But I think it will work until I can’t do it anymore.\nThe problem with this approach is that it’s very difficult to know what to do with an old setup. You have to decide whether or not to keep it, and if you do, which one to use. And even if you decide to keep it, you still have to figure out how to make it work again.\nThis is where the “retire” part comes in. When you retire an old setup, you are essentially saying that you don’t want to use it anymore. This means that you are giving up on it completely. It also means that you are telling other people who might be interested in using it that they should look elsewhere.\nIn order to retire an old setup, you need to find a way to get rid of it. The easiest way to do this is to sell it. However, there are many ways to go about selling an old setup. One way is to give it away. Another way is to donate it to charity. Yet another way is to sell it online.\nThere are many reasons why someone would want to sell their old setup. Maybe they just don’t like it anymore. Or maybe they want to upgrade to something newer. Whatever the reason, there are plenty of options available to help you get rid of your old setup.\nIf you’re looking for a way to get rid of your old setup, we recommend that you try selling it online. There are many websites that offer to buy and sell used electronics. Just make sure that you check the site carefully before making any purchases.\nWe hope that this article has helped you understand how to retire an old setup. We also hope that it has given you some ideas on how to get rid of your old setup."

    "question": "How do you ensure your playbook contains fewer, better plays?",
    "answer": "The best way to ensure that your playbook is full of good plays is to have a great coach. A great coach will help you identify the right plays for your team and make sure they are executed properly.\nThe second best way to ensure your playbook is full of good plays is to be consistent with your play selection. If you’re not consistent in your play selection, then it’s likely that some of your plays won’t work as well as others. For example, if you always run a pass play on first down but never run a run play on third down, then you’ll probably end up with more passing downs than running downs.\nThis is why I think it’s important to have a playbook that has a lot of different types of plays. This way, you can use them all at once without having to worry about which ones are going to work best for your team. It also helps to have a playbook that includes both offensive and defensive plays so that you can mix things up and keep your defense guessing.\nI think this is one of the most important aspects of any football playbook. You need to know what type of play you want to run before you start playing. If you don’t know what type of play you want to run, then you might end up running a play that doesn’t work very well or even worse, runs into a wall of defenders.\nYou should also have a playbook that includes both offensive and defensive plays so that you can mix things up and keep your defense guessing. This is especially important when you’re trying to get your offense off the field quickly because you don’t want to give away too much time by letting your opponent score points.\nA playbook that includes both offensive and defensive plays is essential for any football team. It allows you to mix up your offense and defense and keeps your opponents guessing."

Make sure that all of the lights are on and functioning properly. You should also make sure that there aren't any shadows or reflections on the lens. This will help ensure that your images come out looking their best.\nFinally, take some time to think about what kind of shots you want to take. Are you trying to capture a specific moment? Or maybe you just want to create an overall mood.

    "question": "How do you encode discretion into rules so it can be taught—or audited?",
    "answer": "The answer is to use a rule that has the same form as the one we want to teach. For example, if we want to teach students how to write an essay, we might say “Write an essay in which you explain your position on the issue.” This rule is very similar to the one we want to teach, but it’s not exactly the same because it doesn’t include any of the information about what kind of essay it should be.\nThe problem with this approach is that it’s hard to know whether or not the student will actually follow the rule. If they don’t, then they’re likely to get confused and make mistakes. So we need to find a way to make sure that the student follows the rule without having to worry about them making mistakes.\nThis is where the idea of using a rule that has the same form as the one we want to teach comes in. We can use a rule like “If you are writing an essay, then you must have at least three paragraphs” to ensure that the student follows the rule. But there’s another problem with this approach: It’s easy for the teacher to forget to check the student’s work before grading their essays.\nFor example, suppose I’m teaching my students how to write an essay. I give them a list of topics to cover, and I tell them to write an essay on each topic. Then I ask them to write an essay on each topic. They all write essays on each topic, but some of them don’t follow the rules. Some of them don’t even try to follow the rules.\nI think this is a good example of why we need to use a rule that has the same form as the one we want to teach. Because when we use a rule that has the same form as the one we want to teach, we can be sure that the student will follow the rule. And if the student does follow the rule, then we can be confident that the student will learn something new from the experience.\nIn fact, I think this is a pretty common practice among teachers. When we teach our students how to write an essay, we often give them a list of topics to cover, and we tell them to write an essay on each topic. Then we ask them to write an essay on each topic. They all write essays on each topic, but some of them don’t follow the rules. Some of them don’t even try to follow the rules.\nWe also often give our students a list of topics to cover, and we tell them to write an essay"

You can then tailor your product or service to meet their needs better than anyone else in the market.\nIt’s also important to understand how your competitors are doing business so that you can stay ahead of them by offering something different or better than what they’re currently providing.\nFinally, it’s essential to be able to communicate effectively with customers – whether through email marketing campaigns or social media posts – so that they feel like they’re getting value out of their purchase decision.\nWhat do you delete from your process to make the winning part louder?"
