    "question": "Which habit outside markets most strengthens your judgment inside them?",
    "answer": "The answer is the same as for question 1. It’s not that you’re more likely to make a mistake if you don’t have an outside market, but rather that you are less likely to make a mistake when you do.\nThe reason why this happens is because people who are in markets all day long tend to be very good at judging what they see and hearing what they hear. They can spot trends and patterns much faster than someone who has never been exposed to markets before. This makes it easier for them to identify mistakes and correct them quickly.\nThis is especially true of those who work in finance or other fields where there is a lot of data available. If you want to improve your ability to judge what you see and hear, then you need to spend time studying financial markets and learning how to read them correctly.\nIf you want to become better at making decisions based on information from outside markets, then you should start by reading books about economics and investing. These will give you a basic understanding of how markets work and how to use them effectively.\nIn addition, you should also take courses in statistics and probability theory so that you can understand how statistical models work and how they can be used to predict future events.\nFinally, you should try to find mentors who can help guide you through the process of becoming a successful trader or investor. There are many resources out there that offer advice on how to succeed in these areas, including online forums and blogs dedicated specifically to helping traders and investors learn new skills.\nWhat is the best way to get started with trading? What are some tips for beginners?\nThere are many ways to get started with trading, but one of the most important things to remember is that you must always keep your emotions in check. Trading is a risky business, and it’s easy to lose money if you let yourself get too excited or too frustrated.\nOne of the best ways to stay focused and avoid emotional trading is to set clear goals for yourself. For example, if you want to make $1000 per month in profits, then you should set a goal of making $500 per week. Once you’ve reached this target, then you can increase your profit targets accordingly.\nAnother tip for beginners is to practice trading strategies on paper first before risking any real money. This will allow you to test different approaches without risking any actual capital. You’ll also be able to see how well each strategy works under different conditions, which will help you develop a better understanding of what works best for you.\nHow does the stock market affect my life?\nThe stock"

    "question": "How do you arrange your life so eight hours of sleep outrank eight hours of screens?",
    "answer": "I don’t. But I’m working on it.\nI’ve been thinking a lot about this lately, because I have a new job that requires me to be in front of a computer for 8+ hours per day. It’s not the first time I’ve had to deal with this kind of thing, but it is the first time I’ve done it as my primary source of income. And while I know that there are many people who work at jobs like mine and still manage to get their lives together, I also know that there are many more who can’t. So I thought I’d share some thoughts on how I try to make sure that I don’t end up being one of those people.\nThe first step is to recognize that you’re going to need to change your habits if you want to succeed. This means making sacrifices now, even if they seem small or insignificant. For example, I used to watch TV every night before bed. Now I read instead. That might sound trivial, but it’s actually a big deal when you consider that I was spending an hour watching TV each night before bed, which adds up to over two hours of screen time per week. If I were to continue doing that, I would spend almost three hours of my waking hours staring at a screen each week. That’s a lot of wasted time!\nAnother way to reduce screen time is to use apps like Freedom or Freedom Time. These apps allow you to set limits on how much time you spend looking at your phone or tablet. They also give you the option to block certain websites from accessing your device. While these apps aren’t perfect (they sometimes fail to detect when someone has accidentally opened a blocked website), they can help you stay focused and avoid distractions.\nFinally, remember that technology isn’t always bad. In fact, it can be very helpful in some situations. For instance, I use my laptop to write blog posts and articles. I also use it to research topics for my classes. However, I also use it to watch movies and TV shows. While these activities may not be good for my health, they are still enjoyable and beneficial.\nIn conclusion, reducing screen time doesn’t mean giving up all forms of entertainment. Instead, it means finding ways to enjoy yourself without sacrificing your health or well-being. By taking steps such as limiting screen time, using apps like Freedom or Freedom Time, and remembering that technology isn’t always bad, you can create a healthier lifestyle that includes both physical activity and mental stimulation."

    "question": "What non-market discipline do you practice to keep trading simple?",

    "question": "How do you structure your day so your best hours trade your best ideas?",
    "answer": "I have a 9-5 job, and I work from home. My days are structured around my kids’ school schedules (I’m lucky to be able to work from home). I wake up at 6am every morning, get the kids ready for school, then go back to bed until about 10 or 11 am when they’re done with breakfast. Then I’ll take care of some errands, like picking up groceries, and then I’ll head out to the gym.\nMy schedule is pretty flexible, but it’s important that I make sure I’m getting enough sleep because I need to be alert during the day. I also try to keep myself busy by doing things that will help me think creatively. For example, I might read a book on creativity or listen to an audio book while I’m driving in the car. It helps me stay focused and productive throughout the day.\nWhat does this mean for you? If you want to improve your productivity, start by making sure you’re getting enough sleep. And if you don’t already have a routine, create one that works for you. You can use tools like Pomodoro Technique to break down your tasks into smaller chunks and focus on them for short periods of time. This will help you stay motivated and on track.\nThe key to success is consistency. If you stick to a regular schedule, you’ll find that you become more efficient and productive over time. So set aside some time each day to work on your creative projects, and see how much better you feel as a result!\nHow do you structure your day so your best hours trade your best ideas?\nIf you want to learn more about how to structure your day so your best hours trade your best ideas, check out our blog post here."

    "question": "Which relationship can veto your trading day—and how do you make that a feature?",
    "answer": "The answer is the “Veto” button. It’s located in the top right corner of every chart, and it looks like this:\nThe Veto button allows you to block trades from being executed on any given time frame.\nFor example, if you have a 1-minute chart open, but you want to execute a trade at 2:00 PM EST, you would click the Veto button and then select the 2:00 PM EST timeframe. This will prevent the trade from executing until after 2:00 PM EST.\nThis is a great way to protect yourself from market volatility or unexpected events that may occur during the trading day. By using the Veto button, you can ensure that your trades are only executed when they are most likely to be successful.\nIn addition to protecting yourself from potential losses, the Veto button also provides an opportunity for traders to take advantage of opportunities that arise during the trading day. For instance, if there is a news event that could potentially impact the market, such as a government announcement or a major economic report, you might be able to use the Veto button to lock in profits before the market moves against you.\nOverall, the Veto button is a powerful tool that can help traders stay ahead of the game and maximize their profits. So next time you’re looking to execute a trade, remember to check out the Veto button and see what kind of opportunities it opens up for you!\nHow To Use The Veto Button\nThe Veto button is a useful tool for traders who want to control their trading sessions. Here’s how to use it:\n1. Open a new chart window.\n2. Click on the Veto button.\n3. Select the timeframe you want to use (e.g., 5 minutes).\n4. Enter the amount of money you want to risk per trade.\n5. Set the stop loss level.\n6. Set the take profit level.\n7. Click on the Veto button again to confirm your settings.\n8. Close the chart window.\n9. Repeat steps 1-8 for each desired timeframe.\n10. Start trading!\nUsing the Veto button is a simple process, but it can be helpful for experienced traders who want to fine-tune their trading strategies. If you’re just starting out, however, it’s best to start with a basic strategy and gradually work your way up to more complex ones.\nWhat Is A Veto Button In Trading?\nA veto button is a type of trading system that uses technical analysis to identify potential entry points into the"

    "question": "What do you read that quietly sharpens your edge, month after month?",
    "answer": "I’m not sure if it’s a book or a person. But the one thing that has been consistently helpful to me is reading books by people who are smarter than me.\nI’ve always loved learning from other people and have found that when I read something written by someone else, I can learn more about what they know and how they think than I could ever hope to learn on my own.
